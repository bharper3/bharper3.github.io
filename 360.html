        <h1>360˚ Astronomy Education</h1>
        <p>This page’s purpose is to provide a catalog of useful information regarding 360° videos for astronomy education. Below you learn about 360° videos, find suggestions for teaching with 360° videos, get information on potential materials for teaching, and lastly utilize a catalog of useful 360° videos currently available on YouTube.</p>
        <h3>What is a 360˚ video?</h3>
        <p>
           360° videos often utilize the gyroscopic features of a device to navigate a spherical video. A 360° video is recorded from a point in all directions with multiple lenses or can be generated with software. It can then be viewed with or without using a 360° or virtual reality (VR) viewer. The user is immersed inside the video and can look around in full 360°. This is particularly useful for astronomy, as many astronomical phenomena are geometry and perspective intensive. Viewing objects like quasars, solar systems, and rings around a planet in spherical space is not only more interesting and participative for students but yields deeper understanding.

The final result will be a video where this image is wrapped completely around the viewer located in the center of the scene. The resulting video can be found below.</div>
        

        <h3>Teaching Methods</h3>
        <p>There are a multitude of ways to implement 360˚ videos in astronomy education; however here three potential methods are outlined and based on the number of viewers.</p>
        
        <h4>Individual Viewers</h4> 
        <p>Method: Each student watches video independently with a smart phone and viewer.</p>
        <p>Pros: Maximizes immersivity and does not require any casting capabilities. Students can do it at home.</p>
        <p>Cons: Requires a greater number of smartphones and viewers. Lacks instructor control.</p>
        
        <h4>Single Viewer</h4>
        <p>Method: One student views video  while the screen is projected for others to participate.</p>
        <p>Pros: Retains some immersivity and instructor control.</p>
        <p>Cons: Requires mobile casting capabilites (see section below).</p>
        
        <h4>No Viewer</h4>
        <p>Method: Instructor navigates and discusses video from computer or smartphone while it is projected.</p>
        <p>Pros: No viewers needed and maximizes instructor control.</p>
        <p>Cons: Lacks immersivity and requires some casting capabilites.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Potential Materials</h3>
        <p>
        Software: YouTube is the best choice for finding and playing 360° videos. It can be used on any smartphone or computer.

        Viewer:
            A viewer will hold the smartphone for a more immersive experience. Many viewers exist on the market with a variety of featuers. Google Cardboard is of the most affordable and efficient viewers.

        <p>
        Casting:
            The ability to cast or mirror 360° videos from one device to a projector screen may be vital depending on the method used. Chromecast is a recommended casting device compatible with all smartphones and computers. One can cast from a smarphone to any projector with an hdmi input. It is important to note that, while casting (mirroring) from a smarphone in a viewer, the projected image will be doubled. This is due to the fact that while using a viewer the phone screen plays the video simultaneously for each lens. It is also useful to note that casting can be done with a chromecast directly through a chrome browser. As of now there are also additional issues for iOS users, for 360° videos fail to play properly while using the chromecast. The videos play but only the equirectangular image is casted. These difficulties for screen casting make the second method less favorable when lacking proper equipment, setup, and testing.
